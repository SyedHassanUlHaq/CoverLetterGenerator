**Job:** AI Agent & Automation Specialist — Long Term, High-Volume Projects, 5-Star Guarantee!
**Job Description:** We’re seeking a highly motivated, detail-oriented AI Agent Developer to join us for ongoing, long-term projects. You’ll be at the forefront of building, refining, and maintaining advanced AI automations using no-code/low-code platforms such as Make.com (Integromat), OpenAI tools, Zapier, and related automation platforms. If all projects turn out to be successful, we will invite you to become a business partner, with guaranteed profit sharing. You won’t just be working for us... you’ll be building with us and sharing in the rewards of our growth.  For every project, you’ll get a clear description of what we need—ranging from AI agents to automation solutions. Your job: quickly research and choose the best mix of no-code, low-code, or AI tools (Make.com, OpenAI, Zapier, or anything new) to deliver results at top speed and reliability. You’ll have freedom in your approach, and a pipeline of 30+ diverse projects ready for you to tackle.  We want someone who sees technology as an extension of their own ambition: a partner who stays ahead of the trends, communicates clearly, and loves the challenge of building what hasn’t been done before. You’ll be trusted to choose your methods and encouraged to push boundaries. Most of all, you’ll have the stability of a long-term relationship, a team that values your vision, and a role that grows with you.  We guarantee a 5-star rating and a strong review for every successful project—because when you succeed, so do we.

Your Role: • Project Variety: You’ll tackle 30+ active and upcoming AI projects—from smart auto-posting article bots, to AI voice agents that join meetings and pitch clients, to cutting-edge automated marketing and sales workflows. • Develop, implement, and iterate AI-powered automation workflows using Make.com, Zapier, OpenAI (GPT, Assistants, API), and similar tools • Build, customize, and maintain AI chat agents, customer support bots, or knowledge bases • Integrate third-party services (CRM, email, Google Workspace, web apps, APIs, databases, etc.) • Troubleshoot, optimize, and scale existing automations • Advise on best practices, platform selection, and workflow design • Document and train team members on implemented solutions  Requirements: • Demonstrated experience with Make.com (Integromat), Zapier, or similar automation platforms • Strong working knowledge of OpenAI APIs and conversational agent design • Proficiency with no-code/low-code tools and third-party app integrations • Ability to write/modify simple code (JavaScript, Python, or webhooks) as needed • Creative problem-solving skills, ability to research solutions quickly • Strong communication skills (English), reliability, and attention to detail • Bonus: Experience with Airtable, Notion, Webflow, Bubble, or related platforms  To Apply: Please include the following in your application: • Brief introduction and relevant experience • Specific examples of automation projects you’ve built (links or screenshots appreciated) • Platforms/tools you’re most comfortable with • Your availability (hours/week) and preferred hourly rate  *IMPORTANT: This is not a traditional developer job. We’re not looking for slow, manual, or old-school ways of building apps or coding line-by-line. The world has changed—so has our business. Here, “smart” and “fast” are everything. We move at the speed of AI and expect you to do the same. Each project should be delivered in hours, not days or weeks like the traditional route. If you prefer working slow or by the book, this is not the right opportunity for you.

My plan for your projects: For each workflow, I’ll select the fastest and most stable toolchain to build scalable AI agents and automations. I document everything, collaborate clearly, and iterate rapidly to keep things moving. I’m fully aligned with your mission—this isn’t about building slowly or traditionally. It’s about pushing the edge of what AI can do—and doing it efficiently.
I’m available for 20–30 hours/week and open to long-term commitment, including profit-sharing if we click.
